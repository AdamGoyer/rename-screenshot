# Security Audit Report - rename-screenshot

Date: 2025-06-20 (Updated: 2025-06-20)
Auditor: Claude Code

## Summary

Overall Risk Level: **LOW** (after vulnerability fixes)

The tool appears to be legitimately designed for screenshot organization with no obvious malicious intent. All critical npm vulnerabilities have been patched.

## Positive Security Findings âœ…

1. **No Shell Execution**: No use of `exec()`, `spawn()`, or other shell command execution
2. **Limited Network Access**: Only connects to declared AI providers (Ollama/OpenAI)
3. **Local File Operations**: Restricted to user-specified directories
4. **Open Source**: All code is readable and auditable
5. **Backup Strategy**: Creates backups before renaming files
6. **Input Validation**: Checks for directory existence and file types

## Security Concerns ðŸš¨

### 1. **API Key Exposure Risk** (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Screenshots containing sensitive data are sent to OpenAI
- **Line**: src/index.ts:306-334
- **Risk**: Passwords, API keys, financial data in screenshots could be exposed
- **Mitigation**: Use local Ollama model for sensitive content

### 2. **Path Traversal Potential** (MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: User-provided paths not fully sanitized
- **Line**: src/index.ts:154-164
- **Risk**: Could potentially access unintended directories
- **Mitigation**: Add path normalization and validation

### 3. **Unvalidated JSON Parsing** (LOW)
- **Issue**: Direct JSON.parse() without try-catch on AI response
- **Line**: src/index.ts:348
- **Risk**: Could crash on malformed JSON
- **Mitigation**: Already has try-catch wrapper, but could be more specific

### 4. **File Overwrite Protection** (LOW)
- **Issue**: Relies on simple counter for duplicate filenames
- **Line**: src/index.ts:378-382
- **Risk**: Potential race condition in high-volume scenarios
- **Mitigation**: Current implementation is adequate for typical use

## Dependency Analysis

### Fixed Vulnerabilities (2025-06-20)
âœ… **All 6 vulnerabilities patched via `npm audit fix`**:
- `rollup` DOM Clobbering XSS (HIGH) - Updated to safe version
- `cross-spawn` ReDoS (HIGH) - Updated to safe version  
- `esbuild` Dev server security (MODERATE) - Updated to safe version
- `micromatch` ReDoS (MODERATE) - Updated to safe version
- `brace-expansion` ReDoS (LOW) - Updated to safe version

### Current Dependencies (All Secure)
```json
Dependencies verified safe:
- "openai": "^4.53.0" - Latest version, no known vulnerabilities
- "chokidar": "^3.6.0" - File watching library, verified safe
- "dotenv": "^16.4.5" - Standard for env vars, no issues
- "commander": "^12.1.0" - CLI parsing, well-maintained
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Enable Dependabot**: âœ… Already configured
2. **Add .env validation**: Ensure API keys are properly formatted
3. **Add path sanitization**: Normalize and validate all user-provided paths
4. **Add rate limiting**: Prevent excessive API calls

### Code Improvements
```typescript
// Add to src/index.ts after line 154
const normalizedPath = path.resolve(watchPath);
if (!normalizedPath.startsWith(os.homedir())) {
  console.error("Watch directory must be within user home directory");
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### Configuration Hardening
1. **Add to user.config.json**:
```json
{
  "security": {
    "allowedPaths": ["~/Desktop", "~/Documents/Screenshots"],
    "maxFileSizeMB": 10,
    "rateLimit": {
      "maxRequests": 100,
      "windowMinutes": 60
    }
  }
}
```

## Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **For Sensitive Content**: Use Ollama (local AI) instead of OpenAI
2. **API Key Protection**: Store in `.env` file, never commit
3. **Directory Restrictions**: Only watch trusted directories
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated via Dependabot

## Verdict

The tool is **SAFE TO USE** with the following caveats:
- Use local Ollama for sensitive screenshots
- Be aware that OpenAI mode sends image data to their servers
- Keep the tool updated with security patches
- Monitor the directories it has access to

No evidence of malicious code or intentional backdoors found.
